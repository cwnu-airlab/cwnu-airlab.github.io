The vision of the Adaptive Intelligence Research (AIR) Group at Changwon National University is a ‘**Making the Great! Making the New!**’.

Our work ranges from basic research in computational linguistics to key applications in human language technology and covers areas such as statistical machine translation, opinion mining, and probabilistic parsing and tagging.

A distinguishing feature of the AIR Group is our effective combination of sophisticated and deep linguistic modeling and data analysis with innovative probabilistic and machine learning approaches to NLP. Our research has resulted in state-of-the-art technology for robust, broad-coverage natural-language processing in many languages. These technologies include our part-of-speech tagger for Korean, English, and Chinese; a universal named entity spotter for Korean; a high-performance probabilistic parser for Korean.
